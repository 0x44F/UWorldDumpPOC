# UWorldDumpPOC
POC of an example of Dynamic process analysis to retrieve UWORLD

Note the file provided is only a rough example however I did adapt this in order to get UWORLD for Windows 10
store version of Ark: Survival Evolved and it still works. Do not run this if you don't know what you're doing, it will not 
magically pull UWorld out of nowhere without appropriate knowledge applied to the file itself.
